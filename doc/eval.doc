The following features will be taken into account in El Boana's evaluator:


1. Push Mobility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature counts the number of moves available to each player which
push opponent's discs.  This quantity should be maximized.  If you have
enough choices in pushing your opponent's discs, you will have a strong
central position while your opponent will be scattered, which is good.


2. Potential Push Mobility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature counts discs which have the potential to be pushed.  In addition,
discs which are close to being pushed off the edge are especially important.
The feature is computed as follows:

- discs which can be removed in one push count as 4 points
- discs which can be removed in two pushes count as 2 points
- discs which can be removed in three or more pushes count as 1 point each


3. Capturable Discs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature is a subset of the previous one, counting only discs which can
be immediately removed from the board.  It is maintained separately so that
captures can be recognized one move earlier.  This will detect the end of
the game one move earlier than otherwise, and the evaluator can use a more
accurate count of each side's disc count.


4. Frontier Discs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we simply count the number of frontier discs for each side, once in
each direction.  Note that a disc on the edge is also defined to be a 
frontier disc.  A player should probably try to minimize their frontier
discs in an attempt to form a dense cluster of discs scattering the
opponent on all sides.

5. Disc Strength
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Along each line, discs which are adjacent or are separated only by empty
squares are counted together as a group.  Each disc in a group is given
a value dependent on the size of that group, as follows:

- discs which are singletons are worth 1 point each
- discs which are part of a pair of two are worth 2 points each
- discs in a group of three or more are worth 3 points each


6. Controlled Region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This final feature maintains an estimate of the region of the board
controlled by each player.  It is defined from groups defined above as
follows:

- groups of 3 or more control a margin of 2 squares from each end of the
	group, as well as all discs and spaces within the group
- groups of 2 control a margin of 1 square
- singleton groups control only the square which they occupy

In the case of shared control of a square, neither side is assigned control.
Maximizing the controlled region size should be crucial.
