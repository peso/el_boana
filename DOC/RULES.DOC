                     Attention all programmers!


             The University of Waterloo's Computer Science Club 
                        is proud to announce the

                               First
                       Arbitrary Game Competition

                              featuring

                               Abalone



When: March 27, 1993

Where: University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada

What: Have you always wanted to program a computer to play a game?

      Do you feel nervous entering your program in a tournament where
      other programmers have been honing their programs for several
      years?

      Do you want to try an algorithm different from the standard
      alpha-beta pruned searching?

      Well, then come enter the First International Arbitrary Game
      Competition. This competition will (hopefully) be held twice a
      year. The main theme of the competition is designing programs to
      play a large variety of games.

      The problem with most other competitions (and this includes the
      University of Waterloo's Annual Computer Othello Tournament) is
      that many of the entrants have been implementing and honing
      their programs for many years. In addition, most of them are
      loath to give away details of how their program works for fear
      someone will use an improved version of their own algorithm
      against them in the next tournament.

      The Arbitrary Game Competition is designed so that each
      tournament will feature a different game, thus allowing the
      programmers to explore different types of games over the course
      of several competitions. For example, one tournament may be
      based on full information games (such as checkers / chess /
      othello), another tournament may be based on partial information
      games (such as bridge / poker / backgammon), a third tournament
      may be based dealing with random events during play (board games
      such as Risk / Star Fleet Battles / XBattle / Empire), while yet
      another tournament may be based on interaction with other
      programs (such as Diplomacy).

      In addition, no game will ever be repeated, thus encouraging
      entrants to exchange ideas on how they programmed for the
      previous tournament without giving themselves a disadvantage for
      the next tournament.

      So without further ado, I am proud to announce that the game
      chosen for this upcoming competition is Abalone (a full
      information game).


Abalone Rules:
      1) The board consists of a hexagonal grid (5 spaces along each
         edge).

      2) There are two sides to the game: black and white. Each side
         is in control of 14 marbles.

      3) These marbles are arranged as below:

             O = white marble
             # = black marble
             . = empty space

                            # # # # #
                           # # # # # #
                          . . # # # . .
                         . . . . . . . .
                        . . . . . . . . .
                         . . . . . . . .
                          . . O O O . .
                           O O O O O O
                            O O O O O

      4) A player may move up to 3 marbles of their own colour
         connected in a line one space in any direction provided the
         spaces to be occupied are emptied. Moves are either a
         LINE/PUSH or a BROADSIDE/ROLL.

         A LINE/PUSH is when the player moves 1, 2, or 3 marbles in a
         line by pushing on the last marble.

                  . . # . . . . . .  ==>  . . . # . . . . .  OR

                                          . # . . . . . . .


                  . . # # . . . . .  ==>  . . . # # . . . .  OR

                                          . # # . . . . . .


                  . . # # # . . . .  ==>  . . . # # # . . .  OR

                                          . # # # . . . . .

         This can be in any of the six directions.

         A BROADSIDE/ROLL is when 2 or 3 marbles move in any direction
         other than towards either end of the line:

                  . . # # . . . . .  ==>  . . . . . . . . .  OR
                   . . . . . . . .         . . # # . . . .

                                          . . . . . . . . .
                                           . # # . . . . .


                  . . # # # . . . .  ==>  . . . . . . . . .  OR
                   . . . . . . . .         . . # # # . . .

                                          . . . . . . . . .
                                           . # # # . . . .

      5) More than three marbles of a single colour may NOT be moved
         in a single maneuver.

      6) If the player is making a LINE/PUSH move, the player may
         "push" up to one fewer of the opponent's marbles provided
         there is an empty space or the edge of the board beyond the
         opponent's marbles.

         For example, if a player is moving three marbles in a
         LINE/PUSH move, then the player may "push" either 1 or 2
         opponent marbles to create the empty space for moving.

         Examples of valid pushes are:

                  . . # # # O . . .  ==>  . . . # # # O . . (3 to 1)

                  . . # # # O O . .  ==>  . . . # # # O O . (3 to 2)

                  . . # # O . . . .  ==>  . . . # # O . . . (2 to 1)

         This is called "sumito" (numerical superiority allowing
         forcing).

      7) A player is not obligated to push.

      8) If the opponent's marble is forced off the edge of the
         playing field, then that piece is lost.

      9) The first player to lose 6 marbles loses the game.

      10) No board position may repeat (the Ko rule for Abalone).


Notation Rules:
      1) The coordinate system of the board will be as follows:

             Each row (starting at the bottom with white) will be
             lettered successively starting at 'a'

             Each space within a row, starting the the leftmost space,
             will be numbered successively starting at '1'

         Thus the valid coordinates are a1-a5, b1-b6, c1-c7, d1-d8,
         e1-e9, f1-f8, g1-g7, h1-h6, and i1-i5.

                        i  # # # # #
                       h  # # # # # #
                      g  . . # # # . .
                     f  . . . . . . . .
                    e  . . . . . . . . .
                     d  . . . . . . . .
                      c  . . O O O . .
                       b  O O O O O O
                        a  O O O O O

         As an example, the following marbles are at positions h2, e5,
         and a5.

                        i  . . . . .
                       h  . # . . . .
                      g  . . . . . . .
                     f  . . . . . . . .
                    e  . . . . # . . . .
                     d  . . . . . . . .
                      c  . . . . . . .
                       b  . . . . . .
                        a  . . . . #


      2) Moves will be marked as:

                <tail marble pos><head marble pos>-<new tail marble pos>

         When moving a single marble, no <head marble> is recorded.
         This notation makes sense since people push the tail marble to
         move a row.

         Examples of this notation is given below:

                   i  . . . 3 .               i  . . . . .
                  h  2 2 2 . 3 .             h  . 2 2 2 3 .
                 g  . . . . . 3 .           g  1 . 4 . . 3 .
                f  . 1 4 . 5 5 . 6         f  1 . 4 . . . 3 .
               e  . 1 4 . . . . 6 .   ->  e  1 . 4 . . 5 5 . 6
                d  1 4 . 7 . 8 . .         d  . . . . . . . 6
                 c  . . 7 . . 8 .           c  . . 7 . . 8 .
                  b  . . . . . .             b  . 7 . 9 . 8
                   a  . . 9 . .               a  . . . . .

                1. d1f2-e1
                2. h1h3-h2
                3. i4g6-h5
                4. d2f3-e3
                5. f5f6-e6
                6. f8e8-e9
                7. d4c3-c3
                8. d6c6-c6
                9. a3-b4

      3) Note that a broadside move could be marked in one of two
         ways:

                1. d1f2-e1
             or 1. f2d1-g1


         To make this move recorded by only a single notation, an
         additional restriction is placed on the recording of
         broadside moves. All broadside moves will be considered a
         push move with an offset. Thus, to record the move, pretend
         that the broadside was instead a push in the direction
         closest to the intended direction of broadside, and use that
         orientation for the move specification. For example:

                The marbles d1f2 (or f2d1) can be pushed in a line
                either north-east or south-west.

                Since the broadside is moving north-west, the push
                angle closest to this is north-east.

                A push towards the north-east would have d1 as the
                tail marble.

                Thus the move is marked as d1f2-e1.

         The theory behind this is that all moves must be recorded so
         that the motion is "forwards".

      4) A complete game will have the following notation:

                [Event "1st U. of Waterloo Arbitrary Game Contest"]
                [Site "University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"]
                [Date "1993.03.27"]
                [Round "1"]
                [Black "George Smith"]
                [White "Smash 93"]
                [Result "13(W)-8(L)"]

                1. <black move> <white move> 2. <black move> <white move> 3.
                <black move> <white move> 4. <black move> ...........
                127. <black move> 13(W)-8(L)

         Results are always specified by number of marbles remaining
         for each side and the result for that side.

         Possible letter indications are W=Win, L=Loss, T=Tie,
         R=Resigned, and *=Ran Out of Time

Tournament Rules:
      1) Each side is limited to 40 minutes of playing time with a
         maximum of 200 moves per side.

      2) There is currently a server being worked on that will
         hopefully ease the tournament play. If the server is ready in
         time for the tournament, then any program using the server
         will have exactly 40 minutes of playing time. Any program
         that must go through a human interface to reach the server
         will have the human server time be counted against the
         program (however, the program will be given an extra 5
         minutes to offset this disdavantage ie. the program will be
         givem exactly 45 minutes to play).

      3) Any program that runs out of time will lose that game.

      4) A program will be given up to 30 minutes extra to solve any
         hardware/software problems that occur during the tournament.


Competition Rules:
      1) The programs may be written for any machine. The University
         of Waterloo site will try to provide appropriate hardware,
         but if none is available, alternate arrangements will be made
         to run the program at the author's site.

      2) In hopes of spreading around experiences gained with this
         tournament (and since the code cannot be used in another
         Waterloo tournament), it is requested that all program
         writers please submit a 3-5 page document on the day of the
         tournament describing the techniques used in their programs
         (this can be longer if an author has a really interesting
         idea). The results will be put together for a "proceedings"
         that will be distributed to everybody.


Miscellaneous:
      1) Any questions/inquiries/registration can be sent to:

                     eadengler@watcgl.uwaterloo.ca
                 OR  csc@watmath.uwaterloo.ca

         Anybody who registers will be placed on a mailing list so
         that any discussion with respect to strategy/ideas/concepts
         can be passed on to all contestants.


Good luck, and please enter!!!!
